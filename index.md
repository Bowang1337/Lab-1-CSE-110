Hiya folks, my name is **Bozhi Wang** although I prefer to go by *Steven*  

In this course, I plan to follow the philosophy of Winston Churchill who once said:  

> I am always ready to learn although I do not always like being taught.  

More importantly, I hope to learn the ins and outs of software ~~engineering~~ ***development*** to hopefully create a program more than just above a simple `print('Hello, world!')` 

I am fluent in the following common programming lanuages in order from most to least:
1. Python
2. Java
3. C
4. Javascript
5. C++

Aside from the above, I am also familiar with the following technologies:
- SQL
- Node.js
- React.js
- Docker
- Flask
- HTML / CSS

By the end of the quarter I hope to:
- [x]  Gain a deeper understanding with what it means to be a software developer
- [ ]  Create a functional piece of software that I can be proud of
- [ ]  Build fundamental technical and soft engineer skills
